			<p>Only 8% of women have the so-called "hourglass" figure.</p>

			<p>I want to let you in on a little secret. In talking to dozens of women about fit, they all lament the same thing. Everyone says "I'm hard to fit." There's one thing or another about everyone's bodies that make off-the-rack clothes not work. There's nothing wrong with you, there's something really wrong with retail as we know it.</p>

			<p>It's time for the tears in dressing rooms to STOP. And what's with the horrible lighting... Have you ever looked worse than in that fluorescent glare?</p>

			<p>You're not a number, you're beautiful. We're killing the entire concept of a size. With five measures you already know, we tailor-make a perfect pair just for your curves, no measuring tape needed. </p>

			<p>Take your time trying on your jeans in the privacy of your home. Walk around and see how they fit. Sit down on the couch, drink a cup of tea and make sure they feel just right. And if not, tell us what's too big or small and we'll promise to get it right on the next pair. Free returns. Free shipping both ways.</p>

			<p>I need your help to make this real. I'm sourcing high-quality denim and searching for the right factory here in the US of A to do the stitching. If this idea makes you squeal with joy, sign up to get our newsletter. Even better, fill our our survey. We need data from lots of women with lots of different bodies to prove our fit technology really works.</p>
