 This is a word-for-word rewrite of today's article in <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/shake-shack-economy">The New Yorker about the rise of Shake Shack</a>, a restaurant which focuses of quality and taste in the face of fast-food giants like McDonald's. My words are bracketed so you can see what is original and what's mine. Clothing is today where food was ten or more years ago. I don't know of a better way to convey where I think fashion can and should go and what I hope Qcut will become. So, without further ado, this is the article I hope they'll write about us in ten years...

 In [2015], when [Crystal Beasley] opened a [jean] shop named [Qcut] in [Portland], it didn’t look like the foundation of a global empire. There was just [a Kickstarter project, and Beasley was known for working in open source for Mozilla]. But the lines became legendary, and in [2016] other outlets started appearing—first in New York, then in the rest of the country, then as far afield as Moscow and Dubai. Today, [Qcut] brings in at least a hundred million dollars a year and is planning an I.P.O. that could value the company at a billion dollars. That seems like a lot of jeans, but [Beasley’s] venture was perfectly timed to capitalize on a revolution in the [apparel] business, the rise of [fashion] stores known in the trade as [“made-to-measure”]—places like [Indochino, ModCloth, and Bonobos].

Unlike traditional [apparel] brands, [made-to-measure] emphasize [fit, individual expression, and domestic production]. ([Qcut], for example, lets [women buy any item in their ever-expanding catalog of styles and know that it will fit them exactly].) Perhaps as a result, their [clothes] tend to [look better on people]. It’s also more expensive. The average [H&M] customer spends around [twenty] dollars a visit; the average [Qcut] purchase is [ten] times that. [Made-to-measure brands] first emerged in serious numbers in the [two thousand teens], and though the industry is just a fraction of the size of the traditional [apparel] business, it has grown remarkably quickly. Today, according to the [apparel]-service consulting firm [NPD], it accounts for thirty-four billion dollars in sales. Since [Qcut] went public, in [2022], its stock price has risen more than fifteen hundred per cent.


The rise of [Qcut] and its peers isn’t just a business story. It’s a story about income distribution, changes in taste, and advances in technology. For most of the [apparel] industry’s history, taste was a secondary consideration. [Clothes] were prepared according to a factory model, explicitly designed to maximize volume and reduce costs. [Brands] relied on assembly-line production methods, and their ingredients came from industrial suppliers. They were able to [sell] enormous amounts of [fashion] quickly and cheaply, even if it wasn’t that healthy [for the planet and worker] or [flattering on the customer], and they enjoyed enormous success in the last quarter of the twentieth century. The number of outlets septupled between [1980 and 2010].

But, even as the big [brands] thrived, other trends were emerging. Most of the gains from the economic boom of the eighties and nineties went to people at the top of the income distribution. That created a critical mass of affluent consumers. These people led increasingly busy work lives. They typically lived alone or in dual-income households, so they [shopped online  to save time]. Michael Silverstein, a senior partner at the Boston Consulting Group and the co-author of the book “Trading Up,” has made a study of this kind of consumer. “These aren’t people with unlimited resources, but they have plenty of disposable income,” he told me. “One of the things they’re willing to spend money on is clothes [that were made to fit exactly them].” In the same period, affluent consumers developed a serious interest in fashion and became more discriminating in their tastes—a development often called “the American [apparel] revolution.” 

Traditional [fashion brands] pretty much ignored these changes. They were still doing great business, and their industrial model made it hard to appeal to anyone who was concerned about [fit and domestic manufacturing]. That created an opening for [made-to-measure brands]. You had tens of millions of affluent consumers. They [shopped online] a lot. They were comfortable with fast[-fashion], having grown up during its heyday, but they wanted something other than the typical factory-made [jeans]. So, even as the apparel giants focussed on keeping prices down, places like [Qcut] and [ModCloth] began charging higher prices. Their customers never flinched.

It might seem that the success of [made-to-measure] was simply a matter of producing the right product at the right time. But brands like [Qcut] and [Bonobos] didn’t just respond to customer demand; they also shaped it. As Darren Tristano, an analyst at Technomic, put it, “Consumers didn’t really know what they wanted until they could get it.” The archetype of this model is Starbucks. In 1990, the idea of spending two dollars for a cup of coffee seemed absurd to most Americans. But Starbucks changed people’s idea of what coffee tasted like and how much enjoyment could be got from it. The number of gourmet-coffee drinkers nearly quintupled between 1993 and 1999, and many of them have now abandoned Starbucks for even fancier options.

As Starbucks did for coffee, [Bonobos] and [Qcut] have changed people’s expectations of what [fashion] can be. The challenge for the old [brands] is that new expectations spread. Millennials, for instance, have become devoted [made-to-measure] customers. So [Bonobos] is now experimenting with greater customization, and has said that it would like to rely entirely on "[ethical labor]". The question is whether you can inject an emphasis on [fit] and [domestic manufacturing] into a business built around cheapness and convenience. After decades in which apparel [brands] perfected the “fast,” can they now improve the “fashion”?
